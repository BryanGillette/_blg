So if I create a file in the master, I'll just have added one more file to my list.

If I create a file in a new branch.  That new branch will have all the files that were in the master plus this new file.

If I branch a branch off of this branch.  It will contain all the files in the previous branch plus what ever I add.

If I start a third branch off of the master, I will have two different branches open at the same time.

Now things are starting to get interesting.

Let's say I start making changes in a branch off the master.
I might continue to add files to the branch.
I might delete files from the branch.
Then when I am ready.  I can make a pull request to have my branch merged to the master branch.

Now if all the files are independent of the files on the master branch, there should be no problem.

But where it really becomes interesting is if I have made changes to an existing file in the master.

What happens here, when merging.

Well, my branch could overwrite the original file.  Or we reject the overwriting or perhaps the software takes a look at the text in the file
and compares the two files.  
I may have just added text, would might not be a problem.
but if I have deleted text from the original manuscript, would that be a problem.

I would image, changing text would need be deleting text, so would probably fit into about the same category.
