Body of File 103

I says I have to be on a branch in order to edit.
I'm not sure what 'your problem is', Buddy.
I might have been on a tree.
    I just adding text here.  So there should be any **problems**.
    
        **Okay have we been dicking around editing this file enough.  Shall we try to do something more than 'commit'.
        Perhaps, we should try merging.**

So I made my second commite of this file after adding some text to this file.
Perhaps it is time to edit some text or subtract some text to see what may or may not happend.

So, hitting the commit button, is like 'saving'.
I'm saving my changes.
It's not a statment of what they think they need to do with you.
